[Reference](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/BashCompletion/)

Bash completion is a bash function that allows you to auto complete commands or arguments by typing partially commands or arguments, then pressing the [Tab] key. This will help you when writing the bash command in terminal.

#### Installation

Bash completion will be installed in /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d.
For it to work, add this to your ~/.bash_profile:


```bash

```

Restart your bash session:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile

And you can install them using brew install commands, for example:
